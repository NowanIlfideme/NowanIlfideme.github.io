# Anatoly Makarevich

Lead Data Scientist at [EPAM Systems](https://www.epam.com/).
I specialize in econometrics, time series analysis, and forecasting in the CPG/FMCG and Retail spaces,
including being instrumental in architecting and building several platforms related to forecasting.

See my [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/NowanIlfideme), where my love for the
[Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) library is plain to see.
